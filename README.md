# Epic Seven shop refresher

Script intended to refresh E7 shop in search of summons while AFK. Super slow since I did it as bullet-proof as possible since E7 has
a pretty bad server and connection errors and lags are common.

It's not beginner friendly but if you found this on Github, you'll probably know what to do. 



Requirements are:

Python 3.9.2

adb installed + on PATH. https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools

numpy. "pip install numpy"

OpenCV. "pip install opencv-python"



How to run:

cd to script folder

"python.exe main.py"
